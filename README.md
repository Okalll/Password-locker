This is a terminal driven application that enables creation of accounts and inputing credentials.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To start using this project use the following commands:
* First if the user is not on Github he/she is advised to create an account.
* Once you are on Github you can navigate through account username: Okalll
* Then when you go through my repositories check out a repository called Password-locker.
* `git clone https://github.com/Okalll/Password-locker`
* `cd Git`to get in to the file through Terminal
* Then use `atom .`to open the files to the application.
* One can also use `code.` if you are using vs code.

## Behaviour Driven development.
The application enables a user to search a github username and the in return it displays the user's information.
